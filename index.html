<span>I'm Masha Gilevich, 35 years old, and I live in Israel. I`ve made Aliya (repatriation) from Russia twelve years ago. <br>
It`s been always my passion to try different cuisine and then make an attempt and cook it at home. Being a new repatriate I`ve started to work as a waitress in a hotel restaurant. There I`ve began learning more about cooking. I`ve become a manager pretty soon and that`s how Igot access to even more: adducational courses, trips to factories and wineries, meeting chefs and doing masterclasses. <br>
Eventually it became a significant part of my life - cooking and sharing with my friends.
After a while I`ve decided to share everything I`ve learnt about different kitchens and drinks through the years of working in a Food and Beverage industry with the rest of the world <br>
Of course you can`t live your life and not know how to laugh about it, so several months ago I`ve also started to write a standup, so while looking for a receipe you can also have a laugh with me. <br>
So here are my experiences and I hope you'll enjoy this journey with me. </span>
